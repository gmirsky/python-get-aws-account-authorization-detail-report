- af-south-1
- ap-east-1
- ap-northeast-1
- ap-northeast-2
- ap-south-1
- ap-south-2
- ap-southeast-1
- ap-southeast-2
- ap-southeast-3
- ap-southeast-4
- ca-central-1
- cn-north-1
- cn-northwest-1

`-p` or `--profile`: The AWS profile to pull the AWS credentials from.

`-i` or `--include-non-default-policy-versions`: When downloading AWS managed policy documents, also include the non-default policy versions. Note that this will dramatically increase the size of the downloaded file. 'This can be useful when you want to see the full history of a policy. 'This option is ignored when downloading customer-managed policies.

`-u` or `--include-unattached`: When downloading AWS managed policy documents, also include the unattached policies.

`-o` or `--output`: The output directory and file to save the JSON files to. Defaults to `./accountAuthorizationDetailsReport.json`

`-l` or `--log-level`: The logging level to use. Defaults to `ERROR`. Acceptable choices are: `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`

`-x` or `--open-in-excel`: When included this will trigger the script to open the report in Excel (Windows, Mac) or LibreOffice (Linux)

`-f` or `--flatten`: Flatten the report in Excel/LibreOffice. Note: This will exponentially expand the output.

## Usage

To run the report, you need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured. You can find more information on how to do that here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>

Once you have the AWS CLI installed and configured, you can run the report by running the following command:

```shell
python3 ./generateAccountAuthorizationDetailReport.py --region='us-east-1' --profile='default' --output ./accountAuthorizationDetailsReport1.json --open-in-excel 
```

You should expect the following output:

```sh
